/*
First lab assignment for the data structures lecture. Task specified in pdf:
a)  - write a function, that takes 'n' as an arg 
    - returns count of primes in the interval [2,n] - 'p'
    - also returns 's' - count of stroke numbers
b)  - put that into a program (with main() and stuff) that takes 2^i (i <= 20)
    and gives that to the function a)
    - prints out the return values of the a) function right-bound, newline per val
c)  - plot the whole thing: graph of p and s in correlation to n (make pdf)
d)  - find a function that finds the minimal upper border in time complexity
    of function a)
