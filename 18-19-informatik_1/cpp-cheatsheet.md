## C++ Cheats

This cheatsheet is an extension for the docs provided by Andreas Mueller and Ariane Jacobs for the lectures in Informatik I at TU Chemnitz in Winter 2018/19. It is meant to provide information on all C++ syntax and functions used in the lecture and then some. No guarantee for correctness of any kind is given. The document was written by Softbobo.

### Commentaries

` /* This is a 
Multi-Line comment*/ `
`//This comment ends at the end of the Line`
### Datatypes

Integers: `int`
Floating Points: `float`
Character: `char`
Boolean: `bool`

### Program Structure

Prepocessor directives start with a hashtag `#`
This is used to include files (e.g. headers/libraries) `#include<cmath.h>`

'using' is the keyword to declare a namespace for the whole file: `using namespace std`; 

### Basic I/O

To include the relevant library: `#include<iostream>`
Output formatted text: `cout << "Write your Text here";`
Simple user input to a variable (must be declared beforehand): `cin >> var;`
Linebreak: `endl;`
