## Plotting GPS Data

This is the first assignment for the networks lab. It takes GPS-Data from a 
text-file (data.txt for testing - provided in the task) and returns a new 
text file where each line contains:
- index of data point
- distance covered between this and previous data point
- total distance covered
- time taken between this and previous data point
- total time taken
- speed on last section (not clear which metric we should use for this)
- current height above sea level
- current latitude
- current longitude

Lastly, we ought to plot the height and distance covered using Gnuplot.

### Try It out

### Deprecated Version

Note, that hikeplot.py and modules.py are old versions. I've written such ugly 
spaghetti code that I started all over again.
