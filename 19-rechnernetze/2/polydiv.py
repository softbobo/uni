""" Task is:
Write a script that puts out the modulo of a polynomial division of a string
put in from the terminal and the term x**4+x+1 

what the script needs to do:
- take the string from the CLI (what about exceptions)?
- split the input string into a list
- perform division on that list (horner scheme maybe?)
- make output nice
