/*this file should implement a function that takes an arbitrary count of numbers
to a certain base (between 1 and 36), stores these in a struct (specified in 
basedNumbers.h), parses those to the decimal base and returns the sum of all numbers 
added.
to do:
- implement test-main program (not sure if this is to be incorporated)
- write dedicated function to parse from arbitrary base to decimal
