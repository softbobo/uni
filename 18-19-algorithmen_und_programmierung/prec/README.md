This is the fourth task for the lecture on algorithms and programming winter semester 2018/19. It is required to write an executable binary in C, that takes args from the CLI. Allowed arguments are numbers and following operators: '+', '-', '.', ','.
The algorithm is required to take numbers and operands and perform addition and subtraction according to the number and nature of operands given.
These operations are to be performed with char and int datatypes only, float, double and all other floating point data types are not allowed. Further we musn't use any library functions except printf(), malloc(), calloc() and free(), which are defined in 'stdaup.h'.
The code musn't produce any memory leaks after the program has terminated.
With the exception of return the result, the program musn't output anything else.
The comma is represented by a comma ',', not by a dot '.'.
The dot can be used as an optional sign to better readability of big numbers.
Numbers may be signed. Per default, numbers are positive.
The output should contain only the calculated result, w/o any 'odd zeros', followed by a newline '/n'.
The code may only be decoded in ASCII.
